## This is a Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of String Matching Algorithms:

a. Brute force algorithm.
b. Knuth-Morris-Prattâ€™s algorithm (KMP).
c. Boyer-Moore's algorithm

our Experiments is running Each algorithm for 5 times on a text document (that are randomly generated) of size n (number of characters), where n varies 
from 100 to 10, 000 and increases by 100 each time (that is, n = 100, 200, . . . , 10, 000)

to run the GUI you have to run `GUI2.java` file
and to run the experiment you have to run `main.java` file
